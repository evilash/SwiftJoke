#  SwiftJoke

## Introduction
Just an app that tells bad jokes. 

## Instructions
If you want to check it out, then you'll need to get an API key for it to work. You can request access by going to this [link](https://rapidapi.com/KegenGuyll/api/dad-jokes/) and signing up for a free account. Once you have your key, you'll need to add it to JokeAPIExample.swift on line 20. I've already got the property created for you. Just replace the default value that is already there. You'll also want to rename the `JokeAPIExample` struct to `JokeAPI`. 

## Kudos
Jokes are being served up by Kegen Guyll's `Dad Jokes` API. You can get more info about the API [here](https://dadjokes.io/)
